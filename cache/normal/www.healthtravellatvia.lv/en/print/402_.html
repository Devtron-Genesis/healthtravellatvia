<p class="rtejustify">CyberKnife is the latest-generation non-invasive robotic radiosurgery technology particularly suited for those patients who have tumours that are impossible to reach or whose surgery poses a serious threat to the patient’s health and life.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">The main advantages of CyberKnife technology include the ability to reach tumours that are off limits for traditional surgery. Radiosurgery is pain-free, the treatment process includes 1-5 sessions at an outpatient clinic, requiring no hospitalisation. This method has substantially fewer complications, while the patient’s quality of life is far higher compared to standard surgery. Radiosurgery using CyberKnife is offered to patients as an alternative to or in addition to surgery, and it is the only treatment option to inoperable patients due to the localisation of a particular tumour.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">During therapy, radiation doses are delivered to neoplastic cells from over 1,200 angles with the precision of 0.5-0.95 millimetres. The precision is ensured by the teamwork of professionals, development of a detailed treatment plan, and the technological opportunities of robotised stereotactic radiosurgery of CyberKnife technology. An important factor is that data from past magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) are entered into the CyberKnife system, and data from positron emission tomography – computed tomography (PET-CT) and angiography are also used, based on which specialists and the technology itself can tell healthy tissue and organs from those to be treated with radiation, and automatically follow the movements of the patient and various organs in the body. This negates the need of rigid fixator frames used in other types of radiosurgery or anaesthetics in case of surgery, furthermore, no physical restrictions are placed on the patient during therapy. Following the 30-45 minute treatment session, the patient is free to return to his or her daily routine.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">The first patients at SRC “Sigulda” will arrive at the beginning of December. Initially the Centre will admit patients with primary benign and malignant tumours and metastases in the brain and spinal cord. From 2017, the Centre will offer treatment synchronised with the patient’s breathing, which will make treatment of tumours in other locations possible – lungs, liver, prostate.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">Starting December, the Centre invites patients with the following diagnoses to consult radiotherapist: first of all, brain metastases of various origins and meningioma, vestibular schwannoma (neurilemoma), pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, pineal tumours; second, patients with blood vessel pathology or arteriovenous malformation less than 3 cm, deeply seated and compact; third, functional neurosurgery – for patients with trigeminal neuralgia characterised by intense pain in the face; fourth, metastases in vertebral column. In some individual cases, radiosurgery therapy can also be offered to patients who, for one reason or another, turn down surgery.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">It must be made clear here that CyberKnife is not an alternative to all cases of tumour. This method is primarily meant for treatment of tumours that are no larger than 3 cm in diameter (in very rare cases – up to 5 cm), which is why each case is thoroughly studied before this type of therapy is prescribed, to ensure that CyberKnife can achieve the best result for a given patient.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">In order for the specialist to decide whether modern radiotherapy is possible in a given case, the physician’s diagnosis is necessary, and, in case of tumour, an assessment by the council of oncologists and results of visual examination (computer tomography, magnetic resonance).</p>
<p class="rtejustify"><br />
	To date, more than 100,000 patients around the world have been successfully treated with the CyberKnife system. SRC “Sigulda” currently has the most modern such medical centre in the entire Baltic region. The team of SRC “Sigulda” specialists have trained at the world’s leading radiosurgery training centres in the United States and radiotherapy clinics in Germany and Italy.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">Dr.pharm. Māris Skromanis, Head of SRC “Sigulda”, commented in opening the centre: “This is an important project not only for Sigulda and Latvia, but for all the Baltic countries. SRC “Sigulda” is the first radiosurgery and CyberKnife technology centre in the Baltics, located in the vicinity of Riga, the capital of Latvia. For our patients’ convenience, we are planning to provide professional, quality treatment in combination with top-level comfort, confidentiality, and privacy, as well as free transport from the airport and back.”</p>
<p class="rtejustify">A total of EUR 5.6 million has been invested in purchasing equipment for and construction of “Sigulda”, of which EUR 3.8 million was loaned by “Citadele” Bank, and EUR 1.8 million was contributed by private capital. The project is implemented as part of the fourth round of the High Added Value Investments of the Investment and Development Agency of Latvia, and financed with ERDF funding. An investment in your future!</p>
